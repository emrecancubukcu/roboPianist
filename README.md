roboPianist, Midi Piano Player Character with Autofingering
=============

When I watched Westworld in 2017, I decided to develop a character in unity who plays the piano according to midi notes with correct fingering. 
I started with great enthusiasm, but I did not have time to continue. 
Now I am sharing the code as open source. I hope someone completes it. 

Unity Version:  2020.3.14
